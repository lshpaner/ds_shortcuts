## Data Science Shortcuts  

**Overview**  
Welcome to the Data Science Shortcuts repository! This repository is a collection of useful shortcuts, scripts, and snippets that I've developed or collected during my work as a data scientist at UCLA Health and as an adjunct professor. These tools are designed to streamline various data science tasks, ranging from data processing and analysis to machine learning and visualization.
